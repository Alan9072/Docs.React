My project is a note-taking web application built using React. It allows users to add, view, and delete notes easily. The main interface provides options to switch between light and dark modes for personalization. Each note is represented by a card component, displaying the title, description, and a delete button. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, helping me stay organized and productive with my notes.
